# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

## Short Description
This project is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. It's a fun way to practice C++ and get familiar with basic game logic and console input/output. Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Features
- Simple 3x3 grid drawn in text.
- Two-player gameplay.
- Players take turns entering their moves.
- Checks for a winner after each move.
- Declares a draw if the grid is filled without a winner.
